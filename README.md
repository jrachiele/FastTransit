# VoltBus

Making transit better, one block at a time.

VoltBus is a work in progress. The goals of the project can be split up into phases, which roughly fit into chronological 
order but will have some overlap.

### Goals (subject to change)
#### Phase I 
* Create highly accurate arrival time predictions at Capital Metro bus stops.
* Display real-time transit information, including geolocation data, vehicle speed, and statistics related to arrival times and predictions.

#### Phase II
* Use crowdsourcing to increase data availability and prediction accuracy for arrivals. 
* Use crowdsourcing for real-time user reports about bus conditions, such as whether the bus has working wi-fi, how crowded the bus is, if it has been in an accident, and other general information.
* Use increased data availability to provide more refined and advanced metrics.

#### Phase III
* Expand to other markets outside of Austin. Consider largest markets and markets with poorest public transit service.
* Integrate with other services. The data, metrics, and predictions should be used to improve other services in some way.
